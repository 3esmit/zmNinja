Thanks
------
To the zonemider community in general, and the awesome Stack Overflow community.
But specifically, [Andrew Bauer](https://github.com/knnniggett) (knnniggett) - he is a ZoneMinder maintainer and
helped me significantly in getting into ZoneMinder and also continues to help
me with my client goals. 

Important Notes
---------------
* zmNinja needs APIs enabled in ZoneMinder. See https://github.com/pliablepixels/zmNinja/wiki/Configuring-ZoneMinder-with-API

Objective
----------
Frankly, I wanted to learn how to create a full fledged cross platform app for a long time.
I used this as an excuse to learn Angular JS, phoneGap and ionic and see if one could
use these modern tools to build high performance phonegap apps. I was very pleasantly
surprised -- for a large part, most people who complain about performance  probably
haven't spent time researching how to optimize. 

I'll keep refining it over time as I learn more of AngularJS and stuff.
