ZoneMinder is an incredible open source camera monitoring system and is used
by many for home and commercial security monitoring. http://www.zoneminder.com

The ZoneMinder folks are implementing a new API based system and I decided to contribute
by developing a client that uses the new APIs. The APIs are evolving along with this client
so you can expect this to be in alpha/beta stage till the fine folks at ZM release a new
version with the APIs fully integrated.


This is a very initial version - I'll keep refining it over time as I learn more
of AngularJS and stuff.

Note that I am only currently testing on iOS as a platform for now

My plan is to make the iOS version work and then move to other platforms (Android).



as I mentioned, expect to see many many changes over the next few weeks/months

Bugs/Issues
------------
a) There are MANY right now. Like I said, I'll be working over the next few weeks to clean it up
b) A lot of functionality is still missing - keep a tab
c) The ZM APIs are not fully functional. I unfortunately need to reply on ZM devs to fix them and that will depend on how soon they can address it


Important Notes
---------------
a) You need to have the latest ZM APIs installed. These apis are in the angular-ui branch of ZM.
If you don't know what that means, then you will have to wait till ZM folks integrate their APIs
into the main stream (the current APIs in 1.28 are limited - and will not be sufficient for the client)
